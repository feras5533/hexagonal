# hexagonal

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

to make the api responses work, go to repo/auth_repo.dart,
then you need to change the base url depending on where you
want to open the app, if it is on a physical phone use the
command ipconfig to get the IPv4 Address and use it instead
of 127.0.0.1, if it was on an emulator use 10.0.2.2 instead.
same goes to the laravel file you need to change the APP_URL
 to what you put here (the physical address or the emulator
 address) and contact me using the cv contact details if you
 faced any problem
